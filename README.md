# RF-Filter Design and Analysis with Ideal and Real-World Component Performance in the 900MHz Band

This project was my idea for a project at High Frequency Communication class I took at SDU DK. 

It was based on a discussion in a RF Engineering book I read, about the influence of parasitic components in a High Frequency Filter desing. I decided to investigate it on my own using circuit simulation methods and Finite Element Methods as well (the latter is due upload). Anyway, anyone interested in RF, take a read, I think you could find it quite interesting. 

##### Sk√•l!

### Running the simulation:

Everything you might need to know about the simulations is explained in the Documentation, as its in a form of a report. However, if you please:

To run a simulation and investigate it yourself, you'll need a software capable of running .sch files. The one I used for that project was Qucs (I'm not in any way recommending that software as I know nothing about it's distribution, its just the one that i used). In there you can run the simulations freely and check my results. 

About the FEM simulations. I'm yet to finish them as I'm still learning COMSOL and Ansys, and they're still a mess.
